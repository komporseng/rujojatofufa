Following in the footsteps of her younger brother, she established the company, Todd Patrick. Additionally, she also founded THE BAR TAP, a multi-platform app that links users to bars that complement their tastes. Follow to know more about Desyrée with her Instagram handle (@desyreenicole).</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Next in Fashion</strong></a>, a <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Netflix</strong></a> reality show features a high-level fashion design competition that includes well-known fashion industry figures such as <strong>Donatella Versace</strong>, <strong>Tan France</strong>, and <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>. Designers from all around the world compete in multiple challenges that test their creativity, technical skills, and clothing knowledge for a<strong> $200,000</strong> prize and the opportunity to launch their fashion line.</p><p><strong>Desyrée Nicole</strong>, one of the designers competing to become the next best thing in fashion in season 2, showcased her talents and demonstrated to the judges that she had the potential to earn a spot among the country's great designers. Desyrée is now well-known in the fashion industry, and fans are eager to learn where she is at the moment. Well, we've got you covered.</p><p>Previously, we touched on <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Courtney Smith</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Nigel Xavier</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Danny Godoy</strong></a>.</p><h2>Desyrée Nicole From Next in Fashion Season 2: The Former Basketball Player Turned to the Arts to Make a Name for Herself in the Fashion World!</h2><p>Next in Fashion season 2 cast <strong>Desyrée Nicole</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@desyreenicole</a>) is a Waterford, Michigan native who is currently living her dream life in New York, United States. Eastern Michigan University awarded her a Bachelor of Arts and Science in Art/Graphic Design. However, she later joined a basketball team and played for several years.</p><p>Desyrée Nicole was on track to become the next WNBA superstar, but when her contract expired, she realized she needed to change course. Fashion fell into her hands naturally and quickly became her new love. The designer <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> in an interview with Essence,</p><p><strong>I wanted to be like Swin Cash, Diana Taurasi, or Oprah…Fashion was a second thought after I moved to NY, and I was inspired for sure. I’ve always been into sneakers, but fashion was a different game. I think this shows that it’s never too late to start something new.</strong></p><p>The main goal of Desyrée's design concepts is to stay true to her style while trying to be unique. In 2016, she named her menswear line Todd Patrick after her brother because she thought it would be cool for people to see his name everywhere. Furthermore, since 2019, the former basketball player has been the Founder of The Bar Tap. It is an iPhone app that connects users to their favorite bars.</p><p>Desyrée is also an NFL Wardrobe Stylist, where she advises professional athletes and other clients on their image. Personally: She has been happily engaged to her longtime <a href=# rel=noopener>partner</a> <strong>Gaby Paulino</strong> since 2022. The couple has shared numerous snippets of their life's significant events on social media and cherishes each other on a daily basis. We wish Desyrée and her family a lifetime of happiness and look forward to seeing new collections from the designer.</p><p>Desyrée Nicole specializes in men's wear and lives for androgynous looks. As a result, it came as no surprise when the designer created a men's suit for the Royalty challenge in episode 1. Though the judges praised the fit and style, the excessive use of ribbons, studs, and buttons was deemed unappealing, and she was advised to stick to a more minimalist look. Desyrée slayed the Met Gala look with her fresh take on the sagging culture after putting up a few suitable outfits in consecutive challenges. She wore her boxers as a beautiful heavy skirt with a chic white top with bell sleeves.</p><p>Desyrée received a significant advantage in the next team challenge after winning the task in episode 6. She won the seventh challenge yet again, this time in the Swimsuit challenge, where she chose <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Amari Carter</strong></a> as her teammate and created two great swimwear looks that impressed the judges, earning her team a win in the challenge. Desyrée was eliminated in the eighth challenge, Everything Old is New, where her concept of the 1980s with a pink biker jacket and overcoat didn't land as well as she had hoped, leading to her elimination.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Celebs In-depth</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGibnqupp7Kmec2er61lmaN6p63SoaCopl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./karla-crome-net-worth-bio-early-life-education-career-endorsements-awards-relationship-status-scandal-body-measurements-social-media.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Karla Crome Net Worth, Bio, Early Life, Education, Career, Endorsements, Awards, Relationship Status">&larr;
