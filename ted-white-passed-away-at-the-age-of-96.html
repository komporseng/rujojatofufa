The revelation was first shared on social media by White’s buddy Sean Clark the same day.&nbsp;On October 16, his son Ted reported his father’s death to Fox News. He said,</p><p>“He was a rough character. Whether you liked it or not, he was honest and spoke the truth. “The last of the bloodthirsty thugs.”</p><h2>Ted White cause of death</h2><p>It is unclear whether White had any health problems at the time of his death. His family members are presently awaiting an official announcement on the matter. However, Sean Clark, the owner of Convention All Stars, turned to social media and said that Ted “died quietly in his sleep at his home.” Aside from that, little information concerning the actor’s death has been released.</p><p>Clark said,</p><p>“I just received word that my close buddy Ted White died away while I’m here setting up for Monsterpalooza.” I was informed he died quietly in his sleep at home.”</p><p>Clark praised White, calling him “the finest storyteller you could have ever met.” He said,</p><p>“I’ve had the pleasure of knowing and working with him for over two decades.” He was my adoptive grandfather and, hands down, the finest storyteller I’d ever encountered. If you haven’t already, read his book Cast a Giant Shadow, which contains many of these tales. When he wrote about his experience in the convention industry, I was thrilled to be recognized in the book.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ted-White.jpg alt="Ted White" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ted White has received acclaim for his appearances in cinema and television throughout the years.

He served in the Marine Corps for six years before being contacted to become a consultant for the layout of the island in the 1949 war film, Sands of Iwo Jima.</p><p>In 1952, White met John Wayne and began working as his body double. He appeared in a number of western films and television episodes, including Daniel Boone, Hunter, Rockford Files, The Andy Griffith Show, and Magnum, P.I. White then acted in films such as Gone in 60 Seconds, Silverado, Major League, and others. He rose to prominence after playing serial murderer Jason Voorhees in the fourth edition of the Friday the 13th series, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. The picture, directed by Joseph Zito and released on April 13, 1984, had mixed reviews but earned around $33 million at the box office. White took the part because he needed money and asked not to be acknowledged on television.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ted-White-2.jpg alt="Ted White" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ted White was given the opportunity to reprise his part in the next two films, Friday the 13th: A New Beginning and Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives. He declined to return, thus the parts were filled by Tom Morga and C.J. Graham.&nbsp;Cast a Giant Shadow, a biography of White’s career authored by Larry K. Meredith, was released in 2017.&nbsp;Jeri Bayouth was White’s wife. He had a compassionate and giving heart, she claimed after his death. She even mentioned that he took many risks and had many experiences. His wife and their two boys survive him.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirnpxdrLWqwMRmp5qro5qxbq3WmrBmmaRiwamxjJqenmWfm3p6go4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./interview-with-gomycode-country-head-embracing-the-possibilities-of-tech.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Interview with GOMYCODE Country Head: Embracing the Possibilities of Tech">&larr;
