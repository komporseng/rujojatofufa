Her husband/Rina’s dad Francesco was still surviving at that point.</p><p>Rina in her family also has a brother named Carmine and a sister named Ingrid. The former is married to<span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em> Adele and they have two kids Francesco </span><span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>and Stefano.

So, in her obituary, it’s been written that with her husband Francesco, she worked tirelessly first at Nelson Cleaners, then as owner of Bianca Maria Italian Delicatessen for more than 33 years. Even today, her children believe her to be a force of nature, a champion of the underdog, and a successful businesswoman who gave back selflessly to her church and the community around her.</p><p>At last, let us also tell you that before getting married and adopting her husband’s last name went around as Rina Renzullo.</p><h3><strong>Meet Richard Busse, Emma Busse’s Father</strong></h3><p>Emma Busse’s father Richard Busse is the son of the late Concetta (Rina) Maria Busse and Lee Busse.</p><p>Richard’s dad passed away on 17 December 2022 and before that his mother in January 2017.
