Unfortunately, these three children of Elaine and Dave were out-of-spotlight and didn't find their trace on social media.</span></p><p><span>However, in Netflix's stand-up comedy show&nbsp;Dave Chappelle: Equanimity & The Bird Revelation, he did reveal&nbsp;that he enjoys being fatherhood and how bittersweet it feels to watch your kids grow up. He once found&nbsp;<span>marijuana paraphernalia&nbsp;</span>in his oldest son Sulayman's bedroom. He told the story about his son's poetry and how it came. Meanwhile, his daughter Sonal has followed in his footsteps as she has appeared in a cameo role in the movie A Star is Born.</span></p><p><span>Elaine Chappelle has been interested in becoming a professional chef, but she left as she has to take care of her children.

Their property is a 39-acre farm with a private gate entrance.&nbsp;The house, nestled in ridiculous amounts of greenery, is approximately 3,154 square feet in size and comes with three bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms, which is a perfectly cozy size for his family of 5.
