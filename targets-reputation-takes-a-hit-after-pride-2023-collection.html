Pieces included genderless underwear and swimsuits.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Customers were furious to find clothing for infants in its Pride collection, which was released in stores in May ahead of Pride month in June. <span class=credit>Target</span></figure><p>There were also chest binders — a gender-affirming undergarment often used by transgender and nonbinary people to flatten their chests — and packing boxers, which are made with an extra pocket for a gender-affirming prosthetic.</p><p>Though LGBTQ customers seemed happy with the 2022 Pride line, they still expressed disappointment that the inclusive clothing was only available during Pride celebrations.</p><p>In 2023, Target is under fire for its Pride collection — again.</p><p>This time, <a href=#>rainbow-clad apparel for infants and children, as well as women’s swimsuits offering “extra crotch coverage,” have caused violent outbursts</a>, leading the chain to remove some of the LGBTQ-friendly clothing from its stores.</p><p>“Since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and well-being while at work,” a Target spokesperson said. ”Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.”</p><p>Target declined to confirm which items from its Pride collection would be removed.</p><p>Critics bashed Target for offering “tuck-friendly” women’s swimsuits that allow trans women who have not had gender-affirming operations to conceal their private parts.</p><p>A spokesperson confirmed to the Associated Press that these swimsuits were only offered in adult sizes.</p><p>Elsewhere in the adults section, customers were also upset to find sweatshirts and tote bags with messages that include “Live laugh lesbian,” “Cure transphobia not trans people,” “Too queer for here” and “We belong everywhere.”</p><p>The graphic tees were made by London-based apparel company Abprallen, which is headed by a transgender man known as “Erik” and also <a href=#>sells apparel featuring satanic imagery</a>, like pentagrams, horned skulls and devil references.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Target’s reputational ratings dip was the second-largest fall on the list after Disney. <span class=credit>Axios</span></figure><p>There was plenty of LGBTQ merch in Target’s children’s section that outraged conservative customers as well, including T-shirts&nbsp;that say “Pride Adult Drag Queen ‘Katya,’” “Trans people will always exist!” and “Girls Gays Theys.”</p><p><a href=#>Target CEO Brian Cornell has dismissed the uproar</a> over the retailer’s new line, saying the products are good for business and “the right thing for society.”</p><p>The comments were made during Fortune’s “Leadership Next” podcast.</p><p>The executive, whose company employs more than 450,000 workers in more than 1,900 locations nationwide, added that the company’s strategy is aimed to cater to a diversifying customer base.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25ma2xfqa6zs8StqmaqlaXCta3ToqanZaSWuKa%2FjJpkoaGkYq6nwMSrZKmqmZmybn6Pa2pmm5%2Bhuaav06Kmp2c%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./woman-dead-after-crash-near-lavilla.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Woman dead after crash near LaVilla">&larr;
