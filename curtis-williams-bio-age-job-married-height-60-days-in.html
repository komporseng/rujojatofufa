Content creator Curtis Williams is one of the cast members of 60 Days In and has some idea of what life looks like behind bars in real life. But, more about that in the article below.</p><h3><strong>Curtis Williams On 60 Days In</strong></h3><p>We saw the sheriff at Pitt County Detention Center welcome the participants (cast members) after a recent streak of staff retirements and an inmate drug overdose in the Season 8 trailer of 60 Days In. They are recruited undercover to ensure the proper working of new teams and protocols.</p><p>However, A&E warned that it should be the participants who should remain alert as “conditions are too much to bear” in the North Carolina prison.</p><p>Prison chief Sheriff of North Carolina’s Pitt County Detention Center Paula Dance said, “Apparently, the show had done some research on me and on the detention center. I would think that all of the information out there about the programs inside the detention center must’ve piqued their interest, ” in being at the center of the show.</p><p>Paula also hoped that through the show people will recognize the efforts of detention officers who work around the clock. “… although they’re not on the streets with a gun and a badge, they still serve the same purpose in protecting the community,” Paula said.</p><p>The subject of this article, Curtis Williams, was a prisoner himself. He was incarcerated at age 17 for robbery and spent nearly 17 years behind bars. Curtis was released on July 4, 2013.</p><p>Previously, Curtis has also appeared on an episode of Divorce Court.</p><h3><strong>Curtis Williams Job</strong></h3><p>As per realitytitbit.com, Curtis is a content creator based in Sacramento, California.</p><p>His LinkedIn handle says that he has also been working as a Chief Financial Officer at ALS Non-Profit 501C since May 2016.</p><p>Curtis has a high school diploma in Field Communications from Luther Burbank High School.</p><h3><strong>Is Curtis Williams Married?</strong></h3><p>Curtis Williams got engaged to his fiance <a href=#>Adrena Thomas</a> in June 2020.</p><p>The two are really smitten with each other as their bonding is apparent in their social media posts. Sharing a picture of Adrena and him, Curtis wrote, “Sometimes you get lucky and find the one you’re supposed to be with,” on Instagram on October 31, 2020.</p><p>In another post, Curtis wrote, “Nothing like finding the ying to your yang,” sharing a picture of him with Adrena.</p><p>Born in January 1971, Adrena turned 52 years old in 2023. On her 51st birthday, Curtis posted a birthday tribute to his fiance writing, “Happy Birthday to my Best Friend And fiance Adrena Luster Thomas You deserve the world and more.”</p><p>Adrena is the owner and president of Alternative Life Solutions. She has kids from her previous relationship. On September 25, 2022, she wished his oldest son Shawn a happy 30th birthday.</p><p>Before Adrena, Curtis was married to his wife Lolinda Williams. The two even appeared on an episode of Divorce Court together after Curtis claimed Lolinda was too controlling after his release from prison.</p><p>Although the show’s judge, Lynn Toler, recommended counseling to the couple, they never attended any counseling sessions and parted ways ending 7 years of marriage.</p><h3><strong>Curtis Williams Age</strong></h3><p>60 Days In star Curtis Williams was reportedly born before 1973.

Remembering her during her 17th death anniversary on April 10, 2023, Curtis wrote, “17 years ago Mrs.Ramsey one of the greatest women I knew left this earth.
