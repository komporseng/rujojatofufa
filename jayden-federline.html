While the Toxic singer loves her children, they tend to keep their distance from her.</p><p>Federline did not attend the wedding of his mother, Britney, and Sam Asghari. Yes, the same marriage ended just in 14 months. Let's look at the Spears relationship as we explore Jayden's life</p><h2>Jayden Federline Relationship Status: Is Britney Spears's Son Dating?</h2><p>Britney Spears's son, Jayden Federline probably is single right now. Despite being a celebrity child, Jayden prefers to stay out of the limelight. It's like Federline has mastered the art of being a mysterious person.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/18/Jayden%20Federline%20is%20probably%20single%20right%20now-1692357382149.jpg><p>Federline is out of media reach and so is his dating life. Apparently, he is yet to make a girlfriend. While Jayden's love life is shrouded in a mystery, his mother, Britney Spears divorced her third husband Sam Asghari after just 14 months of marriage.</p><p>Yes, Sam and Britney who first met in 2016 are no longer together. It was Asghari who filed for the divorce citing irreconcilable differences.</p><h3>Sam Asghari Breaks His Silence On Split</h3><p>The pop star Britney Spears married her Instagram model husband <a href=#><strong>Sam Asghari </strong></a>in June 2016. However, their marriage life did not turn out as they expected.</p><p>Speculations of the split between Asghari and Spears started in February 2023. The divorce filing was done on August 17, 2023. It states that the date of separation was July 28.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/8/18/Britney%20Spears%20and%20her%20former%20husband%20Sam%20Asghari-1692357295155.jpg><p>According to Sam, he will always support the pop star even though things between them did not work out. On the divorce file, Sam has asked for spousal support and the right to amend the property and community assets.</p><p>While some source alleges that Asghari is challenging their Prenup agreement, his representative has assured that Sam has no ill intent toward the pop star. They said the model still loves and respects their relationship.</p><h2>Jayden Federline's Parents Got Separated In 2006</h2><p>Britney Spears and Kevin Federline first met at a club in Hollywood called Joseph's. At the time, Kevin was working as a back dancer for Justin Timberlake.

Jayden revealed that the invitation was for him and Sean only and even though they were happy with Spear getting married, things would have not been good if they went.</p><p>"At the time it just wasn't a good time to go. I'm not saying that I'm not happy for her. I'm really happy for them, but she didn't invite the whole family, and then if it was just going to be me and Preston, I just don't see how that situation would have ended on good terms"</p><h2>Jayden Federline's Net Worth & Lifestyle</h2><p>Britney Spear's youngest son Jayden Federline is living a comfortable life.
